hunger 
games 
parti 
the tributes 
 
when i wake up the other side of the bed is cold my 
fingers stretch out seeking prims warmth but finding 
only the rough canvas cover of the mattress she 
must have had bad dreams and climbed in with our 
mother of course she did this is the day of the 
reaping 
i prop myself up on one elbow theres enough light in 
the bedroom to see them my little sister prim curled 
up on her side cocooned in my mothers body their 
cheeks pressed together in sleep my mother looks 
younger still worn but not so beatendown prims 
face is as fresh as a raindrop as lovely as the 
primrose for which she was named my mother was 
very beautiful once too or so they tell me 
sitting at prims knees guarding her is the worlds 
ugliest cat mashedin nose half of one ear missing 
eyes the color of rotting squash prim named him 
buttercup insisting that his muddy yellow coat 
matched the bright flower i le hates me or at least 
distrusts me even though it was years ago i think he 
still remembers how i tried to drown him in a bucket 
when prim brought him home scrawny kitten belly 
swollen with worms
